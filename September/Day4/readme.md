Hard Accuracy: 56.2% Submissions: 4398 Points: 8
Given an array arr[] of N elements. Find the number of non-empty subsets whose product of elements is less than or equal to a given integer K.

 

## Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {2, 4, 5, 3}
K = 12

Output:
8

Explanation:
All possible subsets whose 
products are less than 12 are:
(2), (4), (5), (3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 3), (4, 3)

Example 2:
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {9, 8, 3}
K = 2 

Output:
0

Explanation:
There is no subsets with product less
than or equal to 2.


## Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function numOfSubsets() which takes 2 integers N, and K, and an array arr of size N as input and returns the number of subsets with product less equal to K.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N*2N/2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 30
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10
1 ≤ K ≤ 106
