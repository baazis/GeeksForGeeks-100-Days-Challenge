## Detect cycle in an undirected graph 

Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not. 

Example 1:

Input:   

Output: 1
Explanation: 1->2->3->4->1 is a cycle.
Example 2:

Input: 

Output: 0
Explanation: No cycle in the graph.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isCycle() which takes V denoting the number of vertices and adjacency list as input parameters and returns a boolean value denoting if the undirected graph contains any cycle or not, return 1 if a cycle is present else return 0.

NOTE: The adjacency list denotes the edges of the graph where edges[i][0] and edges[i][1] represent an edge.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Expected Space Complexity: O(V)


 

Constraints:
        1 ≤ V, E ≤ 105
